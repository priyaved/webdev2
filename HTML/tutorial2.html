        The term good vibes means the vibrations you give out to the world and receive back. 
        Vibrations are all around us.  Sound, electricity, even color is determined by their vibration frequency.So where am I going with this?  Well, 
        scientist have been able to discover that when we have thoughts, they give off vibrations too.  
        They have even made games that use the power of our thoughts, if anyone was lucky enough to play with a Mind Flex, a game where you used your thoughts 
        to move a ball around a little obstacle course.  If you haven't yet realized, our thoughts are very important to what we give off into the world.  
        Have you ever met someone who is constantly thinking negatively? 
         They are always talking about how this went wrong or how horrible that is..  What seems to happen to these people?  Bad things happen to them ALL. THE. TIME!

      <ul>
        <li>We want to have good vibes all day, every day. The best way to start this off is getting on that vibe right when you wake up.  
            As soon as you're conscious, think that today is gonna be a good day. <br> Tell yourself that today is going to be awesome and everything is going to be all good. 
             This is gonna set your mood and the events for the rest of the day.</li>  

             <li> Good vibes come to you when you put them out.  If you want people to be cool to you, then you better be cool to them. </li>

             <li>Positive thinking is the key to success and achieving a mind state where you emit positive vibes</li>



      </ul>
